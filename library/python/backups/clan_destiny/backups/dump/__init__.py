    # Once we have the ability to publish private Python packages we can think
    # about moving most of what's here into its own Python 3 program and use
    # async/await to do backups to different hosts concurrently. We could also
    # support signals more easily to make sure the temporary directory is
    # cleaned if we get interrupted.
    # However that means some kind of API so that the external process can
    # consume arguments from Salt and give it a common.states.Result back. This
    # probably involves some JSON shenanigans with stdout and stdin.

    #
    # - Interrupt a backup job if it starts getting too long. Otherwise it can
    #   prevent the other jobs from running. Sometimes the network seems to
    #   stall. In the case of rsync backup jobs this will actually give the job
    #   an opportunity to complete on the next backup run. Async/Await would
    #   make it easy to implement that and there is RuntimeMaxSec in systemd as
    #   well too.
